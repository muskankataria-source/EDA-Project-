# EDA-Project-

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and prepare it for further modeling or decision-making. Key techniques include data cleaning and preprocessing, statistical summaries, visualization to identify trends and distributions, correlation and relationship analysis between key variables, and feature exploration.

In this project, I used a dataset from a survey held by NHANES in 2015-2016. I collected the dataset from kaggle. I conducted descriptive and diagnostic analysis with the aim to collect and compare data of BMI in different age group and gender. This dataset consists of 28 columns and 5735 rows. Among 28 columns, I isolated some columns which are related to my analysis. The dataset I use here relatively friendly and did not need too much intervention for data cleaning because it has no duplicated data and small number of missing values. Besides, the data are also large enough to analyse for various purpose. The distribution of data I used for BMI analysis are also mostly normally distributed or slightly-skewed which make it suitable for modelling.
